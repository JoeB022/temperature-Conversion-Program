Temperature Conversion Program
This is a Python program that converts temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin scales. It prompts the user to input a temperature value and its original unit of measurement, then converts the temperature to the other two units and displays the results.

## Features
Converts temperatures between Celsius (째C), Fahrenheit (째F), and Kelvin (K).

Simple and interactive command-line interface.

Accurate conversion formulas used for calculations.

## How to Use
Clone the Repository (if applicable):

git clone https://github.com/JoeB022/temperature-Conversion-Program.git

cd temperature-Conversion-Program

## Run the Program:
Ensure you have Python installed on your system. Then, run the program using the following command:

python temperature-Conversion-Program.py

## Input Temperature:

Enter the temperature value when prompted.

Specify the unit of measurement (C for Celsius, F for Fahrenheit, or K for Kelvin).

## View Results:
The program will display the converted temperatures in the other two units.

## Example
Enter the temperature value: 25
Enter the original unit of measurement (C, F, K): C

Converted Temperatures:
Celsius: 25.00 째C
Fahrenheit: 77.00 째F
Kelvin: 298.15 K
